# Implementation Plan (v1)

This folder breaks the PRD into implementable parts. Each file includes scope, contracts, acceptance criteria, and sequencing notes.

Suggested sequence (milestones):
1) Foundations: project structure, domain, storage
2) Pet profiles & roles/sharing
3) Logging & schedule awareness
4) History & insights
5) Vacation mode
6) Offline/sync polish, a11y/i18n, QA

Refer to `../specs/PRD.md` for product intent. These docs aim to stay implementation-agnostic but provide concrete contracts.
